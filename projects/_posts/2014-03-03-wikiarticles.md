It is hard to keep track of all the interesting wiki articles out there. Here are some that I find interesting, surprising, and/or awesome. This list is sporadically updated.

[**Faraday cage**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage). An enclosure made from conducting material or mesh. Movement of electrical charges within the conducting material cancel out the effect of an external static field in the interior. Can effectively block EM radiation if holes in the mesh are significantly smaller than the wavelength of the radiation. 

[**Random Forests**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest). A powerful machine learning technique developed at UC Berkeley that builds a large number of decision trees and then uses the mode of the output. It's very fast and does not overfit.

[**Marvellous Spatuletail**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvellous_Spatuletail). An endangered species of hummingbird found in an isolated region in Peru. Males possess two long racquet-shaped, violet tail feathers that make a distinct clicking sound. [Photo](http://ibc.lynxeds.com/files/pictures/Marv._spatultail_copy.jpg).
